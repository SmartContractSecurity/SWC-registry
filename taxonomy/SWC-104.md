# Title 
Unchecked Call Return Value

## Base/Class Type
[CWE252 - Unchecked Return Value](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/252.html)

## Description 
The return value of a message call is not checked. Execution. will resume even if the called contract throws an exception. If the lcall fails accidentally or an attacker can forces the call to fail, this may cause unexpected behaviour in the subsequent program logiuc.

## Remediation
If you choose to use low-level call methods, make sure to handle the possibility that the call will fail by checking the return value.
