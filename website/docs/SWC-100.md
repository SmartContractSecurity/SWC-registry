# Title 
Function Default Visibility

## Relationships 
[CWE-710: Improper Adherence to Coding Standards](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/710.html)

## Description 

Functions that do not have a function visibility type specified are `public` by default. This can lead to a vulnerability if a developer forgot to set the visibility and a malicious user is able to make unauthorized or unintended state changes.     

## Remediation

Functions can be specified as being `external`, `public`, `internal` or `private`. It is recommended to make a conscious decision on which visibility type is appropriate for a function. This can dramatically reduce the attack surface of a contract system.
