# Title
Integer Overflow and Underflow

## Relationships
[CWE-682: Incorrect Calculation](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/682.html)

## Description

An overflow/underflow happens when an arithmetic operation reaches the maximum or minimum size of a type. For instance if a number is stored in the uint8 type, it means that the number is stored in a 8 bits unsigned number ranging from 0 to 2^8-1. In computer programming, an integer overflow occurs when an arithmetic operation attempts to create a numeric value that is outside of the range that can be represented with a given number of bits â€“ either larger than the maximum or lower than the minimum representable value.

## Remediation

It is recommended to use vetted safe math libraries for arithmetic operations consistently throughout the smart contract system.
