# Title 
Shadowing State Variables

## Relationships
[CWE-710: Improper Adherence to Coding Standards](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/710.html)

## Description 

Solidity allows for ambiguous naming of state variables when inheritance is used. Contract `A` with a variable `x` could inherit contract `B` that also has a state variable `x` defined. This would result in two separate versions of `x`, one of them being accessed from contract `A` and the other one from contract `B`. In more complex contract systems this condition could go unnoticed and subsequently lead to security issues. 

Shadowing state variables can also occur within a single contract when there are multiple definitions on the contract and function level. 

## Remediation

Review storage variable layouts for your contract systems carefully and remove any ambiguities. Always check for compiler warnings as they can flag the issue within a single contract.
