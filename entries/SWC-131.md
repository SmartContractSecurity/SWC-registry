# Title
Presence of Unused Variables

## Relationships
[CWE-1164: Irrelevant Code](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1164.html)

## Description
 Unused variables are allowed in Solidity and they do not pose a direct security issue. It is best practice though to avoid them as they can:

* cause an increase in computations (and unnecessary gas consumption)
* indicate bugs or malformed data structures and they are generally a sign of poor code quality
* cause code noise and decrease readability of the code

## Remediation
Remove all unused variables from the code base.
