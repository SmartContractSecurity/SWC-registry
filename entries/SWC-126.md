# Title
Insufficient Gas Griefing

## Relationships
[CWE-691: Insufficient Control Flow Management](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/691.html)

## Description
Insufficient gas griefing attacks can be performed on contracts which accept data and use it in a sub-call on another contract. If the sub-call fails, either the whole transaction is reverted, or execution is continued. In the case of a relayer contract, the user who executes the transaction, the 'forwarder', can effectively censor transactions by using just enough gas to execute the transaction, but not enough for the sub-call to succeed.

## Remediation
There are two options to prevent insufficient gas griefing:

- Only allow trusted users to relay transactions.
- Require that the forwarder provides enough gas.
