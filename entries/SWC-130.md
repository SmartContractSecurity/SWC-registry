# Title
Right-To-Left-Override Control Character (U+202E)

## Relationships
[CWE-451: User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/451.html)

## Description
Malicious actors can use the Right-To-Left-Override unicode character to force RTL text rendering and confuse users as to the real intent of a contract. 

## Remediation
There are very few legitimate uses of the U+202E character. It should not appear in the source code of a smart contract.
