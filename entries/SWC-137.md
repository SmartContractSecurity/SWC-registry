Shadowed Memory Variable in Function Body by Named Returns Statement

## Description
In solidity, it is possible to specify the name of the returned variable from function as well as its value type. The presense of this feature cancels need to both declaring the variable in function body as well as having a `return` statement. However, if the developer mistakenly declares the variable in the function body again, the newly declared variable will not shadow the previously declared variable in function declaration statement. This leads to the function returning the default initial value for named return variable instead of the intended value that is computed in function body since it pertains to another variable only with the same name. The current solidity compiler (0.8.15) does not raise an error, and only shows a warning: `Warning: This declaration shadows an existing declaration.` for the decleration of the variable in function body. This is not correct since the declared variable in function declaration statement will shadow the variable in function body not the other way around.

## Remediation
Do not double declare the varialbe when using named `returns` in function declaration statements or only specify the return value type without name when specifying the returned value.
