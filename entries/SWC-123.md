# Title
Requirement Violation

## Relationships

[CWE-573: Improper Following of Specification by Caller](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/573.html)

## Description

The Solidity `require()` construct is meant to validate external inputs of a function. In most cases, such external inputs are provided by callers, but they may also be returned by callees. In the former case, we refer to them as precondition violations. Violations of a requirement can indicate one of two possible issues:

1. A bug exists in the contract that provided the external input.
2. The condition used to express the requirement is too strong.

## Remediation

If the required logical condition is too strong, it should be weakened to allow all valid external inputs.

Otherwise, the bug must be in the contract that provided the external input and one should consider fixing its code by making sure no invalid inputs are provided.
