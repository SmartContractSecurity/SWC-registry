# Title 
Arbitrary jump with function type variable

[CWE-695: Use of Low-Level Functionality](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/695.html)

## Description 
Solidity supports function types. That is, a variable of function type can be assigned with a reference to a function with a matching signature. The function saved to such variable can be called as a normal one.

The problem arises when a user has the ability to arbitrarily change the function type variable and thus execute random code instructions. As Solidity doesn't support pointer arithmetics, it's impossible to change such variable to an arbitrary value. However, if the developer will use assembly instructions, such as `mstore` or assign operator, in the worst case scenario an attacker will be able to point function type variable to any code instruction, violating required validations and required state changes.

## Remediation
The use of assembly should be minimal. A developer should not allow a user to assign arbitrary values to function type variables.
