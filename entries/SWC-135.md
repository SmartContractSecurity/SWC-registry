# Title
Code With No Effects

## Relationships
[CWE-1164: Irrelevant Code](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1164.html)

## Description
In Solidity, it's possible to write code that does not produce the intended effects. Currently, the solidity compiler will not return a warning for effect-free code. This can lead to the introduction of "dead" code that does not properly perform an intended action.

For example, it's easy to miss the trailing parentheses in `msg.sender.call.value(address(this).balance)("");`, which could lead to a function proceeding without transferring funds to `msg.sender`. Although, this should be avoided by [checking the return value of the call](./SWC-104.md).

## Remediation
It's important to carefully ensure that your contract works as intended. Write  unit tests to verify correct behaviour of the code.
