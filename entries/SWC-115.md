# Title 
Authorization through `tx.origin`

## Relationships
[CWE-477: Use of Obsolete Function](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/477.html)

## Description 
`tx.origin` is a global variable in Solidity which returns the address of the account that sent the transaction. Using the variable for authorization could make a contract vulnerable if an authorized account calls into a malicious contract. A call could be made to the vulnerable contract that passes the authorization check since `tx.origin` returns the original sender of the transaction which in this case is the authorized account.

## Remediation

`tx.origin` should not be used for authorization. Use `msg.sender` instead.
