# Title 
Uninitialised Storage Pointer

## Base/Class ID
[Access of Uninitialized Pointer](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/824.html)

## Description 
Uninitialised local storage variables can point to other unexpected storage variables in the contract, leading to intentional or unintentional vulnerabilities.

## Remediation
It is recommended to explicitly specify the data location `memory` or `storage` when dealing with complex types to ensure they behave as expected.
