# Title 

Multiple Message Calls in a Single Transaction

## Relationships

[CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion')](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html)

## Description 

External calls can fail accidentally or deliberately. To minimize the damage caused by such failures, it is better to isolate each external call into its own transaction that can be initiated by the recipient of the call. This is especially relevant for payments, where it is better to let users withdraw funds rather than push funds to them automatically (this also reduces the chance of problems with the gas limit.)

## Remediation

 Avoid combining multiple send() calls in a single transaction.
