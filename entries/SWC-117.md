[Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/347.html)

## Description

The implementation of a cryptographic signature system in Ethereum contracts often assumes that the signature is unique, but signatures can be altered without the possesion of the private key and still be valid. The EVM specification defines several so-called ‘precompiled’ contracts one of them being `ecrecover` which executes the elliptic curve public key recovery. A malicious user can slightly modify the three values _v_, _r_ and _s_ to create other valid signatures. A system that performs signature verification on contract level might be susceptible to attacks if the signature is part of the signed message hash. Valid signatures could be created by a malicious user to replay previously signed messages.  

## Remediation

A signature should never be included into a signed message hash to check if previously messages have been processed by the contract.
