# Title
Write to Arbitrary Storage Location

## Relationships

[CWE-123: Write-what-where Condition](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/123.html)

## Description

A smart contract's data (e.g., storing the owner of the contract) is persistently stored
at some storage location (i.e., a key or address) on the EVM level. The contract is
responsible for ensuring that only authorized clients may write to sensitive storage
locations. If an attacker is able to write to arbitrary locations within a contracts
storage, the contracts authorization checks may easily be circumvented. This can allow an
attacker to corrupt the storage; for instance, by overwriting a field that stores the
address of the contract owner.

## Remediation

As a general advice, given that all data structures share the same storage (address)
space, one should make sure that writes to one data structure cannot inadvertently
overwrite entries of another data structure.
