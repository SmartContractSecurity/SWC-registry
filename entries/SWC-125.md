Incorrect Inheritance Order

[CWE-696: Incorrect Behavior Order](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/696.html)

## Description 
Solidity supports multiple inheritance, meaning that one contract can inherit several contracts. Multiple inheritance introduces ambiguity called [Diamond Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_inheritance#The_diamond_problem): if two or more base contracts define the same function, which one should be called in the child contract? Solidity deals with this ambiguity by using reverse [C3 Linearization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C3_linearization), which sets a priority between base contracts.

That way, base contracts have different priorities, so the order of inheritance matters. Neglecting inheritance order can lead to unexpected behavior.

## Remediation
When inheriting multiple contracts, especially if they have identical functions, a developer should carefully specify inheritance in the correct order. The rule of thumb is to inherit contracts from more /general/ to more /specific/.
