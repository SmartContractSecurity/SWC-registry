# Title

Function Default Visibility

## Relationships

- [CWE-710: Improper Adherence to Coding Standards](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/710.html)
- EthTrust Security Levels:
  - [**[Q] Code Linting**](https://entethalliance.org/specs/ethtrust-sl/#req-3-linted)

## Description

Functions that do not have a function visibility type specified are `public` by default. This can lead to a vulnerability if a developer forgot to set the visibility and a malicious user is able to make unauthorized or unintended state changes.

## Remediation

Functions can be specified as being `external`, `public`, `internal` or `private`. It is recommended to make a conscious decision on which visibility type is appropriate for a function. This can dramatically reduce the attack surface of a contract system.

## Samples

### visibility_not_set.sol

```solidity
/*
 * @source: https://github.com/sigp/solidity-security-blog#visibility
 * @author: SigmaPrime
 * Modified by Gerhard Wagner
 */

pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract HashForEther {

    function withdrawWinnings() {
        // Winner if the last 8 hex characters of the address are 0.
        require(uint32(msg.sender) == 0);
        _sendWinnings();
     }

     function _sendWinnings() {
         msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);
     }
}

```

#### Comments

The function declarations in lines 11 and 17 do not set the visibility of the functions. At least for Solidity 0.4.24
(as specified in the `pragma` statement), this means they will default to being treated as `public`.
This allows anyone to call the `_sendWinings()` function and take the money.

Instead, the fixed version below restricts the `_sendWinnings()` function visibility to `internal`,
so it can only be activated  by the `WithdrawWinnings()` function that enforces a check
whether the sender actually met the presumed conditions to receive the money.

pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract HashForEther {

        // Winner if the last 8 hex characters of the address are 0.
        require(uint32(msg.sender) == 0);
        _sendWinnings();
     }

     function _sendWinnings() internal{
         msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);
     }
}
