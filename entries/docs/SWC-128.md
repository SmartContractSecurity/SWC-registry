# Title

DoS With Block Gas Limit

## Relationships

- [CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html)
- EEA EthTrust Security Levels:
  - [**[Q] Manage Gas Usage Increases**](https://entethalliance.github.io/eta-registry/security-levels-spec.html#req-3-enough-gas)
  
## Description

When smart contracts are deployed or functions inside them are called, the execution of these actions always requires a certain amount of gas, based of how much computation is needed to complete them. The Ethereum network specifies a block gas limit and the sum of all transactions included in a block can not exceed the threshold.

Programming patterns that are harmless in centralized applications can lead to Denial of Service conditions in smart contracts when the cost of executing a function exceeds the block gas limit. Modifying an array of unknown size, that increases in size over time, can lead to such a Denial of Service condition.

## Remediation

Caution is advised when you expect to have large arrays that grow over time. Actions that require looping across the entire data structure should be avoided.

If you absolutely must loop over an array of unknown size, then you should plan for it to potentially take multiple blocks, and therefore require multiple transactions.
