The content of the SWC registry has not been thoroughly updated since 2020. It is known to be incomplete and may contain errors as well as crucial omissions.

For currently maintained guidance on known Smart Contract vulnerabilities written primarily as guidance for security reviewers, please see the
[EEA EthTrust Security Levels specification](https://entethalliance.org/specs/ethtrust-sl). As well as the latest release version, an
[Editor's draft](https://entethalliance.github.io/eta-registry/security-levels-spec.html) is available, that represents the latest work of the group developing the specification.

General guidance for developers on what to consider to ensure security, that is currently maintained, is also available through the

# Title

Presence of unused variables

## Relationships

- [CWE-1164: Irrelevant Code](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1164.html)
- EthTrust Security Levels:
  - [**[Q] Code Linting**](https://entethalliance.org/specs/ethtrust-sl/#req-3-linted)

## Description

Unused variables are allowed in Solidity and they do not pose a direct security issue. It is best practice though to avoid them as they can:

- cause an increase in computations (and unnecessary gas consumption)
- indicate bugs or malformed data structures and they are generally a sign of poor code quality
- cause code noise and decrease readability of the code

## Remediation

Remove all unused variables from the code base.

## Samples

### unused_state_variables.sol

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;
pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2;

import "./base.sol";

contract DerivedA is Base {
    // i is not used in the current contract
    A i = A(1);

    int internal j = 500;

    function call(int a) public {
        assign1(a);
    }

    function assign3(A memory x) public returns (uint) {
        return g[1] + x.a + uint(j);
    }

    function ret() public returns (int){
        return this.e();

    }

}
```

### unused_state_variables_fixed.sol

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;
pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2;

import "./base_fixed.sol";

contract DerivedA is Base {

    int internal j = 500;

    function call(int a) public {
        assign1(a);
    }

    function assign3(A memory x) public returns (uint) {
        return g[1] + x.a + uint(j);
    }

    function ret() public returns (int){
        return this.e();

    }

}
```

### unused_variables.sol

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.5.0;

contract UnusedVariables {
    int a = 1;

    // y is not used
    function unusedArg(int x, int y) public view returns (int z) {
        z = x + a;  
    }

    // n is not reported it is part of another SWC category
    function unusedReturn(int x, int y) public pure returns (int m, int n, int o) {
        m = y - x;
        o = m/2;
    }

    // x is not accessed
    function neverAccessed(int test) public pure returns (int) {
        int z = 10;

        if (test > z) {
            // x is not used
            int x = test - z;

            return test - z;
        }

        return z;
    }

    function tupleAssignment(int p) public returns (int q, int r){
        (q, , r) = unusedReturn(p,2);

    }


}

```

### unused_variables_fixed.sol

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.5.0;

contract UnusedVariables {
    int a = 1;

    function unusedArg(int x) public view returns (int z) {
        z = x + a;  
    }

    // n is not reported it is part of another SWC category
    function unusedReturn(int x, int y) public pure returns (int m, int n,int o) {
        m = y - x;
        o = m/2;
    }

    // x is not accessed
    function neverAccessed(int test) public pure returns (int) {
        int z = 10;

        if (test > z) {
            return test - z;
        }

        return z;
    }

    function tupleAssignment(int p) public returns (int q, int r){
        (q, , r) = unusedReturn(p,2);
