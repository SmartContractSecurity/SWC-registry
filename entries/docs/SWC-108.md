For currently maintained guidance on known Smart Contract vulnerabilities written primarily as guidance for security reviewers, please see the
[EEA EthTrust Security Levels specification](https://entethalliance.org/specs/ethtrust-sl). As well as the latest release version, an
[Editor's draft](https://entethalliance.github.io/eta-registry/security-levels-spec.html) is available,
that represents the latest work of the group developing the specification.

# Title

State Variable Default Visibility

## Relationships

[CWE-710: Improper Adherence to Coding Standards](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/710.html)

## Description

Labeling the visibility explicitly makes it easier to catch incorrect assumptions about who can access the variable.

## Remediation

Variables can be specified as being `public`, `internal` or `private`. Explicitly define visibility for all state variables.

## Samples

### storage.sol

```solidity
pragma solidity 0.4.24;

contract TestStorage {

    uint storeduint1 = 15;
    uint constant constuint = 16;
    uint32 investmentsDeadlineTimeStamp = uint32(now);

    bytes16 string1 = "test1";
    bytes32 private string2 = "test1236";
    string public string3 = "lets string something";

    mapping (address => uint) public uints1;
    mapping (address => DeviceData) structs1;

    uint[] uintarray;
    DeviceData[] deviceDataArray;

    struct DeviceData {
        string deviceBrand;
        string deviceYear;
        string batteryWearLevel;
    }

    function testStorage() public  {
        address address1 = 0xbccc714d56bc0da0fd33d96d2a87b680dd6d0df6;
        address address2 = 0xaee905fdd3ed851e48d22059575b9f4245a82b04;

        uints1[address1] = 88;
        uints1[address2] = 99;

        DeviceData memory dev1 = DeviceData("deviceBrand", "deviceYear", "wearLevel");

        structs1[address1] = dev1;

        uintarray.push(8000);
        uintarray.push(9000);

        deviceDataArray.push(dev1);
    }
