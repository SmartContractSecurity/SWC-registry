Shadowing State Variables

## Relationships

[CWE-710: Improper Adherence to Coding Standards](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/710.html)

## Description

Solidity allows for ambiguous naming of state variables when inheritance is used. Contract `A` with a variable `x` could inherit contract `B` that also has a state variable `x` defined. This would result in two separate versions of `x`, one of them being accessed from contract `A` and the other one from contract `B`. In more complex contract systems this condition could go unnoticed and subsequently lead to security issues.

Shadowing state variables can also occur within a single contract when there are multiple definitions on the contract and function level.

## Remediation

Review storage variable layouts for your contract systems carefully and remove any ambiguities. Always check for compiler warnings as they can flag the issue within a single contract.

## Samples

### ShadowingInFunctions.sol

```solidity
pragma solidity 0.4.24;

contract ShadowingInFunctions {
    uint n = 2;
    uint x = 3;

    function test1() constant returns (uint n) {
        return n; // Will return 0
    }

    function test2() constant returns (uint n) {
        n = 1;
        return n; // Will return 1
    }

    function test3() constant returns (uint x) {
        uint n = 4;
        return n+x; // Will return 4
    }
}

```

### TokenSale.sol

```solidity
pragma solidity 0.4.24;

contract Tokensale {
    uint hardcap = 10000 ether;

    function Tokensale() {}

    function fetchCap() public constant returns(uint) {
        return hardcap;
    }
}

contract Presale is Tokensale {
    uint hardcap = 1000 ether;

    function Presale() Tokensale() {}
}

```

### TokenSale_fixed.sol

```solidity
pragma solidity 0.4.25;

//We fix the problem by eliminating the declaration which overrides the prefered hardcap.

contract Tokensale {
    uint public hardcap = 10000 ether;

    function Tokensale() {}

    function fetchCap() public constant returns(uint) {
        return hardcap;
    }
}

contract Presale is Tokensale {
    //uint hardcap = 1000 ether;
    //If the hardcap variables were both needed we would have to rename one to fix this.
    function Presale() Tokensale() {
        hardcap = 1000 ether; //We set the hardcap from the constructor for the Tokensale to be 1000 instead of 10000
    }
}

```
