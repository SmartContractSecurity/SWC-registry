## Description

Using an outdated compiler version can be problematic especially if there are publicly disclosed bugs and issues that affect the current compiler version.

## Remediation

It is recommended to use a recent version of the Solidity compiler.

## Samples

### version_0_4_13.sol

```solidity
pragma solidity 0.4.13;

contract OutdatedCompilerVersion {
    uint public x = 1;
}

```

#### Comments

As of August 2023 the current version of the compiler is 0.8.21. There are several dozen compiler bugs that have been fixed between that and version 0.4.13,
each of which can lead to data being corrupted, contracts not functioning as expected, or unexpected vulnerabilities in contracts.
There have also been significant improvements in compiler capabilities to protect against errors.
