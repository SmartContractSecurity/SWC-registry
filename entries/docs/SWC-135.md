# Title

Code With No Effects

## Relationships

- [CWE-710: Improper Adherence to Coding Standards](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/710.html)
- EthTrust Security Levels:
  - [**[Q] Code Linting**](https://entethalliance.org/specs/ethtrust-sl/#req-3-linted)

## Description

In Solidity, it's possible to write code that does not produce the intended effects. Currently, the solidity compiler will not return a warning for effect-free code. This can lead to the introduction of "dead" code that does not properly perform an intended action.

For example, it's easy to miss the trailing parentheses in `msg.sender.call.value(address(this).balance)("");`, which could lead to a function proceeding without transferring funds to `msg.sender`. Although, this should be avoided by [checking the return value of the call](./SWC-104.md).

## Remediation

It's important to carefully ensure that your contract works as intended. Write  unit tests to verify correct behaviour of the code.

## Samples

### deposit_box.sol

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.5.0;

contract DepositBox {
    mapping(address => uint) balance;

    // Accept deposit
    function deposit(uint amount) public payable {
        require(msg.value == amount, 'incorrect amount');
        // Should update user balance
        balance[msg.sender] == amount;
    }
}
```

### deposit_box_fixed.sol

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.5.0;

contract DepositBox {
    mapping(address => uint) balance;

    // Accept deposit
    function deposit(uint amount) public payable {
        require(msg.value == amount, 'incorrect amount');
        // Should update user balance
        balance[msg.sender] = amount;
    }
}
```

### wallet.sol

```solidity
/*
 * @author: Kaden Zipfel

pragma solidity ^0.5.0;

contract Wallet {
    mapping(address => uint) balance;

    // Deposit funds in contract
    function deposit(uint amount) public payable {
        require(msg.value == amount, 'msg.value must be equal to amount');
        balance[msg.sender] = amount;
    }

    // Withdraw funds from contract
    function withdraw(uint amount) public {
        require(amount <= balance[msg.sender], 'amount must be less than balance');

        uint previousBalance = balance[msg.sender];
        balance[msg.sender] = previousBalance - amount;

        // Attempt to send amount from the contract to msg.sender
        msg.sender.call.value(amount);
    }
}
```

### wallet_fixed.sol

```solidity
/*
 * @author: Kaden Zipfel

pragma solidity ^0.5.0;

contract Wallet {
    mapping(address => uint) balance;

    // Deposit funds in contract
    function deposit(uint amount) public payable {
        require(msg.value == amount, 'msg.value must be equal to amount');
        balance[msg.sender] = amount;
    }

    // Withdraw funds from contract
    function withdraw(uint amount) public {
        require(amount <= balance[msg.sender], 'amount must be less than balance');

        uint previousBalance = balance[msg.sender];
        balance[msg.sender] = previousBalance - amount;

        // Attempt to send amount from the contract to msg.sender
        (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call.value(amount)("");
        require(success, 'transfer failed');
    }
}
