# Title

Weak Sources of Randomness from Chain Attributes

## Description

Ability to generate random numbers is very helpful in all kinds of applications. One obvious example is gambling DApps, where pseudo-random number generator is used to pick the winner. However, creating a strong enough source of randomness in Ethereum is very challenging. For example, use of `block.timestamp` is insecure, as a miner can choose to provide any timestamp within a few seconds and still get his block accepted by others. Use of `blockhash`, `block.difficulty` and other fields is also insecure, as they're controlled by the miner. If the stakes are high, the miner can mine lots of blocks in a short time by renting hardware, pick the block that has required block hash for him to win, and drop all others.

## Remediation

- Using external sources of randomness via oracles, and cryptographically checking the outcome of the oracle on-chain. e.g. [Chainlink VRF](https://docs.chain.link/docs/chainlink-vrf). This approach does not rely on trusting the oracle, as a falsly generated random number will be rejected by the on-chain portion of the system.
- Using [commitment scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commitment_scheme), e.g. [RANDAO](https://github.com/randao/randao).
- Using external sources of randomness via oracles, e.g. [Oraclize](http://www.oraclize.it/). Note that this approach requires trusting in oracle, thus it may be reasonable to use multiple oracles.
- Using Bitcoin block hashes, as they are more expensive to mine.
