# Title

Unencrypted Private Data On-Chain

## Relationships

- [CWE-767: Access to Critical Private Variable via Public Method](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/767.html)
- EthTrust Security Levels:
  - [**[Q] No Private Data**](https://entethalliance.github.io/eta-registry/security-levels-spec.html#req-3-no-private-data)
  - [**[Q] Enforce Least Privilege**](https://entethalliance.github.io/eta-registry/security-levels-spec.html#req-3-access-control)

## Description

It is a common misconception that `private` type variables cannot be read. Even if your contract is not published, attackers can look at contract transactions to determine values stored in the state of the contract. For this reason, it's important that unencrypted private data is not stored in the contract code or state.

## Remediation

Any private data should either be stored off-chain, or carefully encrypted.

}

#### Comments

The vulnerable version above requires the players to send the number they are using
as part of the transaction.
This means the first player's number will be visible, allowing the second player to select a number
that they know will make them a winner.
(This assumption is simplistic to illustrate - there are also possibilities to front-run players,
among other potential issues).

In the fixed version below, the players instead submit a commitment that obfuscates their number,
and only subsequently reveal that they know the secret to set in train the process of a payout.
