# Title

Typographical Error

## Relationships

- [CWE-480: Use of Incorrect Operator](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/480.html)
- EEA EthTrust Security Levels:
  - [**[Q] Implement as Documented**](https://entethalliance.github.io/eta-registry/security-levels-spec.html#req-3-implement-as-documented)

## Description

A typographical error can occur for example when the intent of a defined operation is to sum a number to a variable (+=) but it has accidentally been defined in a wrong way (=+), introducing a typo which happens to be a valid operator. Instead of calculating the sum it initializes the variable again.

The unary + operator is deprecated in new solidity compiler versions.

## Remediation

The weakness can be avoided by performing pre-condition checks on any math operation or using a vetted library for arithmetic calculations such as SafeMath developed by OpenZeppelin.
