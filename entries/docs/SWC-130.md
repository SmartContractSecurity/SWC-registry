# Title

Right-To-Left-Override control character (U+202E)

## Relationships

- [CWE-451: User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/451.html)
- EEA EthTrust Security Levels specification:
  - [**[S] No Unicode Direction Control Characters**](https://entethalliance.org/specs/ethtrust-sl/#req-1-unicode-bdo)
  - [**[M] No Unnecessary Unicode Controls**](https://entethalliance.org/specs/ethtrust-sl/#req-2-unicode-bdo)
  - [**[M] No Homoglyph-style Attack**](https://entethalliance.org/specs/ethtrust-sl/#req-2-no-homoglyph-attack)

## Description

Malicious actors can use the Right-To-Left-Override unicode character to force RTL text rendering and confuse users as to the real intent of a contract.

## Remediation

There are very few legitimate uses of the U+202E character. It should not appear in the source code of a smart contract.

#### Comments

The line

```
checkAndTransferPrize(/*The prize‮/*rebmun desseug*/n , p/*
```

inside the function `guess(uint n)` uses invisible direction control characters, so what is present on the screen misrepresents the order
of the parameters - the function is called with parameters `n, p, address`, which is the **logical order** of characters,
but some are displayed from right to left, so that the segment 'n, p' appears in reverse order to a reader,
because invisible direction control characters are included in the code.

Selecting the text character by character will usually show this - the selection suddenly jumps to the end of the right-to-left text,
and starts to extend from the right hand side leftward. It is also possible to check for the unicode characters explicitly in the content.
