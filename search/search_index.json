Miners review the transactions they have received and select which ones to include in a block, based on who has paid a high enough gas price to be included. Additionally, when transactions are sent to the Ethereum network, they are forwarded to each node for processing. Thus, a person who is running an Ethereum node can tell which transactions are going to occur before they are finalized. A race condition vulnerability occurs when code depends on the order of the transactions submitted to it.</p> <p>The simplest example of a race condition is when a smart contract gives a reward for submitting information. Suppose a contract will give out 1 token to the first person who solves a math problem. Alice solves the problem and submits the answer to the network with a standard gas price. Eve runs an Ethereum node and can see the answer to the math problem in the transaction that Alice submitted to the network. So, Eve submits the answer to the network with a much higher gas price, and thus it gets processed and committed before Alice's transaction. Eve receives one token, and Alice gets nothing, even though it was Alice who worked to solve the problem. A common way this occurs in practice is when a contract rewards people for calling out bad behavior in a protocol by giving a bad actor's deposit to the person who proved they were misbehaving.</p> <p>The race condition that happens most frequently on the network today is the race condition in the ERC20 token standard. The ERC20 token standard includes a function called 'approve', which allows an address to approve another address to spend tokens on their behalf. Assume that Alice has approved Eve to spend n of her tokens, then Alice decides to change Eve's approval to m tokens. Alice submits a function call to approve with the value n for Eve. Eve runs an Ethereum node, so she knows that Alice is going to change her approval to m. Eve then submits a transferFrom request, sending n of Alice's tokens to herself, but gives it a much higher gas price than Alice's transaction. The transferFrom executes first so gives Eve n tokens and sets Eve's approval to zero. Then Alice's transaction executes and sets Eve's approval to m. Eve then sends those m tokens to herself as well. Thus, Eve gets n + m tokens, even though she should have gotten at most max(n,m).</p>"},{"location":"docs/SWC-114/#remediation","title":"Remediation","text":"<p>A possible way to remedy race conditions in the submission of information in exchange for a reward is called a commit reveal hash scheme. Instead of submitting the answer, the party who has the answer submits hash(salt, address, answer) [salt being some number of their choosing]; the contract stores this hash and the sender's address. To claim the reward, the sender then submits a transaction with the salt, and answer. The contract hashes (salt, msg.sender, answer) and checks the hash produced against the stored hash. If the hash matches, the contract releases the reward.</p> <p>The best fix for the ERC20 race condition is to add a field to the inputs of approve, which is the expected current value, and to have approve revert if Eve's current allowance is not what Alice indicated she was expecting. However, this means that your contract no longer conforms to the ERC20 standard. If it is important to your project to have the contract conform to ERC20, you can add a safe approve function. From the user's perspective, it is possible to mitigate the ERC20 race condition by setting approvals to zero before changing them.</p>"},{"location":"docs/SWC-114/#references","title":"References","text":"<p>General Article on Race Conditions ERC20 Race Condition</p>"},{"location":"docs/SWC-114/#samples","title":"Samples","text":""},{"location":"docs/SWC-114/#erc20sol","title":"ERC20.sol","text":"<pre><code>pragma solidity ^0.4.24;\n\n/** Taken from the OpenZeppelin github\n * @title SafeMath\n * @dev Math operations with safety checks that revert on error\n */\nlibrary SafeMath {\n\n  /**\n  * @dev Multiplies two numbers, reverts on overflow.\n  */\n  function mul(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {\n    // Gas optimization: this is cheaper than requiring 'a' not being zero, but the\n    // benefit is lost if 'b' is also tested.\n    // See: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/pull/522\n    if (a == 0) {\n      return 0;\n    }\n\n    uint256 c = a * b;\n    require(c / a == b);\n\n    return c;\n  }\n\n  /**\n  * @dev Integer division of two numbers truncating the quotient, reverts on division by zero.\n  */\n  function div(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {\n    require(b &gt; 0); // Solidity only automatically asserts when dividing by 0\n    uint256 c = a / b;\n    // assert(a == b * c + a % b); // There is no case in which this doesn't hold\n\n    return c;\n  }\n\n  /**\n  * @dev Subtracts two numbers, reverts on overflow (i.e. if subtrahend is greater than minuend).\n  */\n  function sub(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {\n    require(b &lt;= a);\n    uint256 c = a - b;\n\n    return c;\n  }\n\n  /**\n  * @dev Adds two numbers, reverts on overflow.\n  */\n  function add(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {\n    uint256 c = a + b;\n    require(c &gt;= a);\n\n    return c;\n  }\n\n  /**\n  * @dev Divides two numbers and returns the remainder (unsigned integer modulo),\n  * reverts when dividing by zero.\n  */\n  function mod(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {\n    require(b != 0);\n    return a % b;\n  }\n}\n\n\ncontract ERC20 {\n\n  event Transfer( address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value );\n  event Approval( address indexed owner, address indexed spender, uint256 value);\n  using SafeMath for *;\n\n  mapping (address =&gt; uint256) private _balances;\n\n  mapping (address =&gt; mapping (address =&gt; uint256)) private _allowed;\n\n  uint256 private _totalSupply;\n\n  constructor(uint totalSupply){\n    _balances[msg.sender] = totalSupply;\n  }\n\n  function balanceOf(address owner) public view returns (uint256) {\n    return _balances[owner];\n  }\n\n\n  function allowance(address owner, address spender) public view returns (uint256)\n  {\n    return _allowed[owner][spender];\n  }\n\n  function transfer(address to, uint256 value) public returns (bool) {\n    require(value &lt;= _balances[msg.sender]);\n    require(to != address(0));\n\n    _balances[msg.sender] = _balances[msg.sender].sub(value);\n    _balances[to] = _balances[to].add(value);\n    emit Transfer(msg.sender, to, value);\n    return true;\n  }\n\n  function approve(address spender, uint256 value) public returns (bool) {\n    require(spender != address(0));\n\n    _allowed[msg.sender][spender] = value;\n    emit Approval(msg.sender, spender, value);\n    return true;\n  }\n\n  function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 value) public returns (bool) {\n    require(value &lt;= _balances[from]);\n    require(value &lt;= _allowed[from][msg.sender]);\n    require(to != address(0));\n\n    _balances[from] = _balances[from].sub(value);\n    _balances[to] = _balances[to].add(value);\n    _allowed[from][msg.sender] = _allowed[from][msg.sender].sub(value);\n    emit Transfer(from, to, value);\n    return true;\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"docs/SWC-114/#eth_tx_order_dependence_minimalsol","title":"eth_tx_order_dependence_minimal.sol","text":"<pre><code>/*\n * @source: https://github.com/ConsenSys/evm-analyzer-benchmark-suite\n * @author: Suhabe Bugrara\n */\n\npragma solidity ^0.4.16;\n\ncontract EthTxOrderDependenceMinimal {\n    address public owner;\n    bool public claimed;\n    uint public reward;\n\n    function EthTxOrderDependenceMinimal() public {\n        owner = msg.sender;\n    }\n\n    function setReward() public payable {\n        require (!claimed);\n\n        require(msg.sender == owner);\n        owner.transfer(reward);\n        reward = msg.value;\n    }\n\n    function claimReward(uint256 submission) {\n        require (!claimed);\n        require(submission &lt; 10);\n\n        msg.sender.transfer(reward);\n        claimed = true;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"docs/SWC-115/","title":"Please note, this content is no longer actively maintained.","text":"<p>The content of the SWC registry has not been thoroughly updated since 2020.

Smart contract systems that process signed messages have to implement their own logic to recover the authenticity from the signed messages before they process them further. A limitation for such systems is that smart contracts can not directly interact with them because they can not sign messages. Some signature verification implementations attempt to solve this problem by assuming the validity of a signed message based on other methods that do not have this limitation. An example of such a method is to rely on <code>msg.sender</code> and assume that if a signed message originated from the sender address then it has also been created by the sender address.
